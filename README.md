# PHONEBOOK

This project in C++ aims to develop a phonebook by using self-defined Hash Map. This project offers many functionalities to the user like add contact , delete contact and fetch contact.
Fetch contact function takes a query as input and returns contact accordingly. If we just provide a part of name to query , then also
our fetch function works accurately. Hash Map ensures that all the above operations runs efficiently with less run-time and less memory usage. Collision handling is also done accurately with the help of separate chaining method. So , whether for personal or professional use, this implementation serves as a reliable and scalable solution for organizing and accessing contact details.
